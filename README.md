# Urban Explorer: Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to building a 3D urban exploration experience using React and Three.js. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a progressive development path that balances core functionality with visual enhancements.

## 1. Project Setup
* Create React app (if not exists)
* Install core dependencies (R3F, Drei, Rapier)
* Basic scene structure with canvas

## 2. First-Person Controls
* Implement keyboard movement (WASD)
* Add mouse look controls
* Sprint functionality (Shift key)

## 3. Basic City Layout
* Procedural building generation
* Simple road system
* Ground plane with basic texture

## 4. Collision System
* Add physics boundaries to buildings
* Implement ground collision
* Prevent wall/object penetration

## 5. Visual Enhancements
* Day/night cycle system
* Street lights with dynamic illumination
* Basic building textures

## 6. Performance Optimization
* Implement LOD for buildings
* Add distance culling
* Optimize rendering with memoization

## 7. Interactive Elements
* Door opening mechanics
* Information panels for landmarks
* Simple UI for interactions

## 8. Advanced Features
* Interior spaces for buildings
* Sound effects
* Save/load positions
